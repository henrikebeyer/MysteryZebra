Zebra_3domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each given clue and piece together the information step by step.

Let's break down and list out all the clues:

1. The English person drives a motorbike.
2. The Spanish person has singing as their hobby.
3. The person drinking coffee is driving the bus.
4. The Ukrainian drinks tea.
5. The person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the ship.
6. The fan of hip-hop has writing as their hobby.
7. The fan of quad-bikes drives the subway.

12. The fan of D&B drinks orange-juice.
13. The Japanese person's favorite music genre is rock.
14. The Norwegian is next to the person driving the quad-bike.

Now let's assign this information into a 5-seater arrangement:

**Position: Left, Middle, Right**

Given:
9. Norwegian (N) is on the far left.

So, we start with:
- Position 1 (Left): N
- Position 2 (Middle): M (Milk drinker)
- Position 3 (Right): R (Unknown for now)

From clue 3, the person drinking coffee is driving the bus. This means they are not in position 1 or 3 (since the Norwegian is already there and the middle position has milk).

Thus:
- Position 2: M
- Coffee drinker drives the bus

Clue 4 tells us that the Ukrainian drinks tea.

So, we update our positions:

- Position 1 (Left): N (Norwegian)
- Position 2 (Middle): M (Milk drinker)
- Position 3 (Right): R (Unknown for now)

From clue 5, the person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the ship. This means:
- The person in position 2 (middle) drives the bus.
- Therefore, the person in position 1 (left) must drive the ship.

So, we have:

- Position 1: N (Norwegian), Ship driver
- Position 2: C (Coffee drinker)
- Position 3 (Right): R (Unknown for now)

Clue 7 tells us that the fan of quad-bikes drives the subway. So:
- The person in position 4 must drive the subway.
- And they are a fan of quad-bikes.

So, we have:

- Position 1: N (Norwegian), Ship driver
- Position 2: C (Coffee drinker)
- Position 3: R (Unknown for now)
- Position 4: Q (Quadbike driver)

Clue 8 tells us the person drinking milk is in the middle, which we already have:

- Position 1: N (Norwegian), Ship driver
- Position 2: M (Milk drinker)
- Position 3: R (Unknown for now)
- Position 4: Q (Quadbike driver)

Clue 9 states the Norwegian is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. This confirms our seating:

- Position 1: N (Norwegian), Ship driver
- Position 2: M (Milk drinker)
- Position 3: R (Unknown for now)
- Position 4: Q (Quadbike driver)

Now, using clue 10:
The fan of trance is next to the person with photography as a hobby.

Clue 6 tells us that the fan of quad-bikes drives the subway. This means the person driving the subway has writing as their hobby:

- Position 4: Q (Quadbike driver)
- Hobby: Writing

So, we have:
- Position 1: N (Norwegian), Ship driver
- Position 2: M (Milk drinker)
- Position 3: R (Trance fan, Photography hobby)
- Position 4: Q (Quadbike driver)

Clue 14 states the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. This confirms our seating:

Finally, using clue 6 and 7:
- The fan of hip-hop has writing as their hobby.
- The fan of D&B drinks orange juice.

This means the person drinking orange juice must have D&B as a favorite genre. 

Using all these clues, we can now conclude that the hobbies for each position:

- Position 1: N (Norwegian), Ship driver
- Position 2: M (Milk drinker)
- Position 3: R (Trance fan, Photography hobby)
- Position 4: Q (Quadbike driver)

We are left to identify the music and beverage preferences for each person. We can then solve it by process of elimination:

From clue 1:
The English drives a motorbike.
So, position 5 must be the English with Motorbike.

Clue 2: Spanish has singing as their hobby.
Position 3 (R) is not singing, so it's Position 5 (English).

Clue 6: Fan of quad-bikes is driving subway.
So, Position 4 (Q) fan of quad-bikes.

Clue 13: Japanese person's favorite music genre is rock.
So, the English must have Rock as their favorite, and the remaining genres fit:

Thus:
- Position 5 (English): Motorbike, Rock

We can now finalize:
- Position 2: M (Milk drinker)
- Position 3: R (Trance fan, Photography hobby)
- Position 4: Q (Quadbike driver)

The board-games hobby must be in position 3.

So the final answer is:
**board-games:3**"	board-games:5	board-games:3	False	True
Zebra_3domain_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, let's organize and use the given clues systematically:

1. The order of birthdays (May, January, July) can be deduced from clue 5.
2. Clues about travel locations help us understand the arrangement.

From clue 6:
- **Old-gold-smoker** is the owner of **snails**.

From clue 7:
- The **kools-smoker** has a birthday in **June**.

From clue 3 and 14, we can infer that the order of months (considering January on the left and May on the right) with respect to travel locations and positions:

Clue 9: **Person traveling to Venice is in the middle.**
Clue 8: The person traveling to Berlin drives a van.

Clue 2: The person driving the ship owns the dog.
Clue 10: The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
Clue 11: The kools-smoker (June) is to the left or right of the horse-owner.
Clue 4: The van-driver travels to Berlin.

Let's construct a possible arrangement based on clues:

- Position 1:
  - Helicopter driver (clue 9, clue 14)
  - Not January (because January is to the right of July).
  - Could be May or June.
  
- Position 2: 
  - (Left or middle for kools-smoker and fox-owner)

- Position 3:
  - Venice-traveler (clue 8, clue 9)
  - Not June, because it's a different month.

- Position 4:
  - Berlin traveler (clue 4) - Van driver

- Position 5: 
  - Hamburg or another city (to be determined)

Considering the order of months and the constraints:

1. Person with birthday in January is to the right of July.
2. May > January > July
3. Helicopter-driver (May) -> Leftmost.

Let's place these step by step:
- Position 1: Helicopter driver (May)
- Position 2: Kools-smoker and owner of horse (June, but not in middle or far left).
- Position 3: Berlin traveler (Van driver), must be June.
- Position 4: Owner of dog (ship) is January.
- Position 5: Hamburg.

By placement:
1. **Helicopter** - May
2. **Kools**/Horse - June (middle)
3. **Ship** - Dog owner - January
4. **Van** - Berlin traveler - June 
5. **Skateboard** - Old-gold-snails

So, the location of Hamburg is:

**hamburg:5**"	hamburg:1	hamburg:5	False	True
Zebra_3domain_replacements_1	"Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Analyzing Statements

- **Statement 9**: The person traveling to Venice is in the middle.
- **Statements 2 and 4**: 
    - The person driving the ship owns a dog.
    - The person driving the van travels to Berlin.
- **Statement 5**: The birthday in January is to the right of the birthday in July. This implies that July comes before January chronologically, but we'll place them based on their relative positions after other constraints are satisfied.

### Step 2: Placing Month and Travel

From statements 3 and 4:
- **Person traveling to Hannover** has a birthday in January.
- The person driving the van travels to Berlin (statement 4).

### Step 3: Positioning Transport

- **Statement 9**: The person traveling to Venice is in the middle, so they are not at positions 1 or 5.

- From statement 2 and 4:
    - The ship owner owns a dog.
    - The van driver travels to Berlin.

From statements 7 and 8:
- The kools smoker (birthday in June) is to the left of the horse owner, so they can't be at positions 4 or 5.
- The lucky-strike smoker travels to Colone.

### Step 4: Placing Month

- January: Traveling to Hannover
- July: Before January chronologically but we'll place based on other constraints.
- June: Kools smoker, so not in the middle (position 3).
- September: To be determined, must be after July and before January.

### Step 5: Placing Remaining Month

Since May is only mentioned with the quad-bike driver:
- May has to be at position 1 or 2.
- July can't be at position 5 as it's before January.
- Therefore, **May** is in position 1 (since July needs a spot and January must come after July).

### Step 6: Final Placement

- May (Quad-bike driver)
- July
- September
- January (Hannover travel)
- June (Kools smoker)

### Step 7: Pets, Transport, Brands, and Cities

- **Statements 2 and 4**:
    - Ship owner owns a dog.
    - Van to Berlin.

- **Statement 6**: Old-Gold smoker has snails. 
- **Statement 7**: Kools smoker (birthday in June).
- **Statement 8**: Traveler to Venice is middle, so position 3.
- **Statements 9 and 14**:
    - Helicopter driver is left or right of September person.
    - Helicopter driver cannot be at position 5.

### Step 8: Determining Transport

From statements 9, 10, and 11:
- Traveler to Venice (position 3) is not the ship owner, so could be quad-bike, van, helicopter, or skateboard.
- Lucky-strike smoker travels to Colone, so position 5.

Given the constraints:
- **Helicopter** driver must be at position 2 due to relative placement of September and June.
- The remaining transport positions are:
    - May (quad-bike)
    - July (skateboard, because other constraints fit).
    - September (van or helicopter, but van is fixed for Berlin travel).

### Step 9: Final Allocation

- **Horse owner**: Kools smoker
- **Dog owner**: Ship (statement 2)
- **Snails**: Old-Gold (statement 6)

### Step 10: Placement of Pets

- Traveler to Venice at position 3.
- Positioning remaining pets:
    - Fox and Zebra must fill the remaining spots.

Given all constraints, we place the zebra as follows:

**Zebra:3**

So, the final answer is **zebra:3**."	zebra:5	zebra:3	False	True
Zebra_3domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and piece together the given clues step by step. Let's start organizing the information:

1. **Nationalities and Sports:**
   - English: cycling (Clue 1)
   - Spanish: poker (Clue 2)
   - Ukrainian: December birthday (Clue 4)
   - Norwegian: leftmost position (Clue 9), surfing
   - Japanese: Parliaments cigar (Clue 13)

2. **Birthdays and Sports:**
   - March: Ice-hockey (Clue 3)
   - May: Middle (Clue 8)
   - December: Ukrainian (Clue 4)
   - September: Lucky-strike smoker (Clue 12)
   - August: To be determined

3. **Sports and Positions:**
   - Ice-hockey to the right of basketball
   - Basketball is not in March or December.
   - Therefore, basketball could be in March, May, September, or August.

4. **Cigars and Games:**
   - Old-gold smoker plays snooker (Clue 6)
   - Kools smoker plays baseball (Clue 7)
   - Chesterfields-smoker is near the billiard player (Clue 10)
   - Kools-smoker is near the domino player (Clue 11)

5. **Sports and Positions:**
   - Ice-hockey to the right of basketball.
   - Basketball could be in March, May, September, or August.

Let's start placing some pieces based on these clues:

- Norwegian at position 1, smoking Parliaments, playing surfing (Clue 9).
- Ukrainian in December (Clue 4), so Ukrainian cannot play ice-hockey as it is in December.
- English plays cycling (Clue 1).
- Spanish plays poker (Clue 2).

Now let's place the birthdays and sports:

1. Norwegian - Parliaments - Surfing
2. English - Cycling
3. ?
4. Ukrainian - December
5. Spanish - Poker

Given that the Ukrainian has a December birthday, they cannot be in position 2 or 4 (which are likely to have later months), leaving positions 3 and 5 for them.

Considering Clue 8 states ""May is middle"", May must be at position 3.

Positioning the other players and their sports:

1. Norwegian - Parliaments - Surfing
2. English - Cycling
3. ?
4. Ukrainian - December
5. Spanish - Poker

Now, placing the games and cigars:

- Ice-hockey to the right of basketball.
- March is for ice-hockey (Clue 3).
- May is middle, so positions 2 or 4 could be for basketball.

Since Ukrainian has a December birthday, they can't play ice-hockey. Therefore, basketball must be in position 2, which leaves August as the only possible month left that fits all conditions.

Thus, we determine:

**August:3**

This means August is positioned at number 3, and the person with the August birthday plays basketball (as it’s to the right of ice-hockey)."	august:1	august:3	False	True
