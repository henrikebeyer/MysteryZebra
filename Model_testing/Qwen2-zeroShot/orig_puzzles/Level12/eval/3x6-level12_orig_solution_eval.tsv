Lv12-3x6-4	"Let's solve this step-by-step using the given constraints:

### Step 1: Analyze the Constraints

1. The person drinking juice is not the person watching spy movies or the paramedic is not the person drinking juice or both.
2. The person watching thriller movies is the person drinking milk.
3. The videographer is somewhere between the dancer and the person watching thriller movies.
4. The person watching crime movies is not the person drinking 7up or the person watching crime movies is not the police-officer or both.
5. The person watching sports movies and the paramedic have different parity positions.
6. The police-officer is not to the left of the person watching spy movies.
7. The person watching sports movies is not to the right of the person drinking juice.
8. The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the right of the firefighter.
9. The person drinking milk is in an even position.
10. The police-officer and the person watching musical movies have different parity positions.
11. The person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies.
12. The software-developer is somewhere to the right of the paramedic.
13. The person watching crime movies is somewhere between the videographer and the person watching musical movies.
14. The paramedic and the person watching thriller movies have the same parity positions.

16. The videographer is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
17. The person watching spy movies is the police-officer.
18. The dancer is between the person drinking cola and the person drinking 7up.
19. The police-officer is not the person watching action movies or the police-officer is not the person drinking 7up or both.
20. The person drinking milk is on the left of the software-developer.
21. The software-developer is not the person drinking juice.
22. The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the person drinking fanta.
23. The videographer is not to the right of the paramedic.

### Step 2: Deductions

- From constraint 2, the person watching thriller movies drinks milk.
- From constraint 17, the person watching spy movies is the police-officer.
- From constraint 9, the person drinking milk is in an even position (position 2 or 4).
- From constraint 14, the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies (police-officer) have the same parity positions, so the police-officer is in position 2 (since the person watching thriller movies is in position 2).

So, the police-officer is in position 2 and drinks milk.

- From constraint 6, the police-officer is not to the left of the person watching spy movies, which means the person watching spy movies is in position 3 or 4 or 5 or 6.
- From constraint 16, the videographer is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade, so the person drinking lemonade is in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6.
- From constraint 20, the person drinking milk (position 2) is on the left of the software-developer, so the software-developer is in position 4, 5, or 6.

### Step 3: Placing Remaining Elements

- From constraint 1, the person drinking juice is not the person watching spy movies (position 3, 4, 5, 6), so the person drinking juice must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 6.
- From constraint 14, the paramedic and the police-officer (position 2) have the same parity positions, so the paramedic is in position 4 or 6.
- From constraint 11, the person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies.
- From constraint 12, the software-developer is somewhere to the right of the paramedic.
- From constraint 13, the person watching crime movies is somewhere between the videographer and the person watching musical movies.
- From constraint 18, the dancer is between the person drinking cola and the person drinking 7up.

### Step 4: Final Placement

Let's try placing elements based on the above deductions:

1. Person drinking milk (position 2)
2. Police-officer (position 2)
3. Spy movies (position 3)
4. Software-developer (position 4)
5. Paramedic (position 6)
6. Juice (position 1)

Now we need to place the remaining elements:
- Cola, 7up, lemonade, fanta, dancer, firefighter, action, crime, musical, sports, thriller

Given the constraints:
- From constraint 18, the dancer is between cola and 7up. So, the dancer is in position 3 or 5.
- From constraint 15, the person drinking 7up is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade. So, if the dancer is in position 3, then 7up and lemonade must be in positions 4 and 5.
- From constraint 21, the software-developer is not the person drinking juice, so the software-developer is in position 4.
- From constraint 13, the person watching crime movies is somewhere between the videographer and the person watching musical movies. So, the person watching crime movies can be in position 3, 5, or 6.
- From constraint 8, the person watching sports movies is somewhere to the right of the firefighter. So, the firefighter is in position 1, and the person watching sports movies is in position 3, 5, or 6.
- From constraint 11, the person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 26**: The person watching romance movies is on the far right.
   - Romance movies go in column 6.

2. **Clue 6**: The person drinking almond-milk is the person driving the tram or the person watching romance movies is the person drinking almond-milk or both.
   - Since the person watching romance movies is in column 6, and they can either be drinking almond-milk or driving the tram, let’s assume they are drinking almond-milk first (we'll verify later).

3. **Clue 1**: The person watching romance movies is not the person driving the tram or the person driving the tram is not the person drinking almond-milk or both.
   - This confirms that the person watching romance movies cannot be the one driving the tram, and if they were drinking almond-milk, it must be someone else.

4. **Clue 16**: The person driving the train is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies.
   - This gives us two possible positions for the person driving the train relative to the person watching mystery movies.

   - So, the person driving the train drinks milk.

    - Mystery movies and the van must be in even or odd positions.

### Solving Step-by-Step:

#### Step 1: Place the known values:
- From Clue 20: **Cranberry** (owner of the lizard) is at position **4**.
- From Clue 21: **Magic-Tricks** (eating cauliflower) is at position **3**.
- From Clue 22: The owner of the hamster must be in an odd position, so it can be at **1**, **3**, or **5**.

#### Step 2: Use other clues to deduce more values:
- From Clue 1: Since **Magic-Tricks** (position 3) is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower, the person eating cauliflower (position 3) must be in an adjacent position. This confirms that the person eating cauliflower is indeed at **3**.
- From Clue 6: Broccoli (position 6) is on the left or right of the person eating peas (position 3).
- From Clue 7: Broccoli (position 6) is to the right of the person eating tomato (position 5).

#### Step 3: Continue filling in based on clues:
- From Clue 11: The owner of the lizard (position 4) and the person with the hobby of video-games have different parity positions. Since the lizard is in an even position, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in an odd position. Therefore, the person with the hobby of video-games is at **1** or **3** or **5**.
- From Clue 12: The owner of the pony cannot be the person with the hobby of collecting or the person eating cranberry. Since the person eating cranberry (position 4) is the owner of the lizard, the owner of the pony cannot be at **4**. This leaves the possible positions for the owner of the pony as **1**, **2**, **3**, **5**, or **6**.

#### Step 4: Final deductions:
- From Clue 23: The owner of the lizard (position 4) is to the left of the person with the hobby of magic-tricks (position 3). This means the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is at **3**.
- From Clue 24: The person eating broccoli (position 6) is on the left or right of the person with the hobby of board-games. Since the person with the hobby of magic-tricks (position 3) is the person eating cauliflower, the person with the hobby of board-games must be at **4** or **5**.
- From Clue 14: The owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the person eating peas (position 3). This means the owner of the guinea-pig is at **4**, **5**, or **6**.
- From Clue 15: The person with the hobby of video-games (position 1) is between the person with the hobby of magic-tricks (position 3) and the owner of the guinea-pig (position 5).
- From Clue 16: The person with the hobby of magic-tricks (position 3) is between the person with the hobby of video-games (position 1) and the person eating tomato (position 5).
