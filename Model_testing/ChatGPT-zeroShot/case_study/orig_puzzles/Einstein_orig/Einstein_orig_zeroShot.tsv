### Step 3: Filling out the grid

Using the clues, we can start assigning each item to the correct house. Here’s the process:

| House | Color   | Nationality | Beverage | Cigar      | Pet    |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|
| 1     | Yellow  | Norwegian   | Water    | Dunhill    | Cats   |

| 5     | White   | Swede       | Beer     | Bluemaster | Dogs   |

### Step 4: Explanation

- **House 1**: The Norwegian lives in house 1 (Clue 9), and since the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house (Clue 14), house 2 is Blue.

- **House 2**: The Blue house must be house 2, and the Dane lives there (Clue 3). The Dane drinks Tea (Clue 3) and smokes Blend (Clue 15). The person who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water (Clue 15), which works since house 1 drinks Water. The Dane also keeps Horses (Clue 11).

15. **The owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water.**
   - The person who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water.

### Step 3: Fill in the houses

Thus, the answer is **cats:1**."	cat:1
Einstein_orig_birds-2	birds	8	"Let's approach this step by step, using the clues to fill out the puzzle.

### Step 1: Organizing the grid

We have five houses in a row, each with a different color, nationality, beverage, cigar, and pet. Here's how we can organize the information:

| House # | 1           | 2           | 3         | 4         | 5         |

Thus, the answer is **birds:3**."	bird:3
Einstein_orig_dogs-2	dogs	7	"Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Organizing the houses

We have the following five houses:

1. House 1
2. House 2
3. House 3
4. House 4
5. House 5

Each house has a different color, a different nationality, a different beverage, a different cigar, and a different pet. We need to fill in all the details using the clues provided.

### Step 2: Applying the clues

1. **The Brit lives in a Red house.**
   - The **Brit** must live in the **Red** house. This tells us the **Red** house is not House 1, since it’s specified later that the Norwegian lives in House 1. The Brit must be in House 3.

2. **The Swede keeps Dogs as pets.**
   - The **Swede** must live in House 5 and keep **Dogs** as pets.

3. **The Dane drinks Tea.**
   - The **Dane** drinks **Tea**. The only house left for the Dane (since House 1 is occupied by the Norwegian, House 3 by the Brit, and House 5 by the Swede) is House 2. Therefore, the **Dane** is in House 2 and drinks **Tea**.

4. **The Green house is on the left of the White house.**
   - The **Green** house must be to the left of the **White** house. This means the **Green** house can only be in House 4, with the **White** house in House 5. 

5. **The Green house owner drinks Coffee.**
   - The owner of the **Green** house drinks **Coffee**, so House 4 drinks **Coffee**.

6. **The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds.**
   - The owner who smokes **Pall Mall** keeps **Birds**. The **Brit** lives in House 3, so the **Brit** must be the one who smokes **Pall Mall** and keeps **Birds**.

7. **The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.**
   - The owner of the **Yellow** house smokes **Dunhill**. The only available house for the **Yellow** house is House 1, so the **Norwegian** must live in House 1 and smoke **Dunhill**.

8. **The owner living in the center house drinks Milk.**
   - The owner in the center house (House 3) drinks **Milk**.

9. **The Norwegian lives in the first house.**
   - This confirms that the **Norwegian** is in House 1.

10. **The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats.**
    - The person who smokes **Blend** must live next to the person who keeps **Cats**. House 2 must be the one that smokes **Blend**, and House 1 must have **Cats**.

11. **The owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.**
    - The person who keeps **Horses** lives next to the one who smokes **Dunhill**. This must mean the person in House 2 keeps **Horses**.

12. **The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer.**
    - The person who smokes **Bluemaster** drinks **Beer**. The **Swede** in House 5 must smoke **Bluemaster** and drink **Beer**.

13. **The German smokes Prince.**

14. **The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house.**
    - The **Norwegian** in House 1 lives next to the **Blue** house, which must be House 2.

15. **The owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water.**
    - The person who smokes **Blend** (the Dane in House 2) has a neighbor who drinks **Water**. This must mean that House 1 drinks **Water**.

### Step 3: Filling the grid

Now we fill in all the information based on the clues:

| House #  | 1           | 2           | 3         | 4         | 5         |

   Since the Red house is house 3 and the White house is house 4, house 5 must be Green, and the owner of house 5 drinks Coffee.

7. **The Swede keeps Dogs as pets** (Clue 2).  
   The Swede must live in house 5 (Green house) because of the pets and the placement.

8. **The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill** (Clue 7).

### Step-by-step deductions:

#### Step 1: Assign positions to the houses.

- **House 1**: Norwegian (Clue 9)
- **House 2**: Blue house (Clue 14: The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house)

#### Step 2: Color placement.

- **Green house is to the left of the White house** (Clue 4). Therefore, the Green house must be in House 4, and the White house must be in House 5.

#### Step 3: Nationality and pet assignment.

- The **Brit** lives in the Red house (Clue 1). Since House 1 is occupied by the Norwegian, the Brit must live in House 3.
- The **Swede** keeps **Dogs** as pets (Clue 2). Since the only house left for the Swede is House 5, House 5 must also have Dogs.

#### Step 4: Beverage assignment.

- The **owner living in the center house drinks Milk** (Clue 8). Therefore, House 3 has Milk.
- The **Green house owner drinks Coffee** (Clue 5). Hence, House 4 has Coffee.
- The **Dane drinks Tea** (Clue 3), and the only available house for the Dane is House 2, which is Blue.

#### Step 5: Cigar assignment.

- **The owner who smokes Dunhill lives in the Yellow house** (Clue 7), so House 1 must have Dunhill, and thus it is Yellow.
- **The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer** (Clue 12), so the owner in House 4 must smoke Bluemaster and drink Beer.
- **The German smokes Prince** (Clue 13). Since House 4 is occupied by the Brit, House 5 must have the German, who smokes Prince.

#### Step 6: Pet assignment.

- The **owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water** (Clue 15), so **Blend** must be smoked by the person in House 2, and the neighbor (House 1) drinks Water.
- **The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats** (Clue 10). Hence, House 1 has Cats.
- Therefore, **Horses** must be kept in **House 2** (because House 2 is the only one left without a pet).
