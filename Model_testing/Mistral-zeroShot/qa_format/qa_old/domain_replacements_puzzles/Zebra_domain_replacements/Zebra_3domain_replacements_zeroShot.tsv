Zebra_3domain_replacements_0	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Assign variables for each characteristic (M for motorbike, B for bus, S for ship, Q for subway, K for quad-bike, E for English, SPA for Spanish, UKR for Ukrainian, NOR for Norwegian, JP for Japanese, HH for hip-hop, TR for trance, DB for d&b, RK for rock, C for coffee, T for tea, MILK for milk, OJ for orange-juice, W for water, SG for singing, P for photography, BG for board-games, F for fishing, WR for writing).
2. Use the given information to make initial assumptions and eliminate possibilities (e.g., from 1 we know E drives M, so M can't be Q, B or K; similarly, S is singing, so SG can't be C, T, MILK, OJ or W).
3. Use the transitive properties to make further assumptions (e.g., if we know that A is to the left of B, and B is to the right of C, then A must be on the right of C).
4. Continue applying logic based on the given clues until all variables are assigned a value.

After solving the puzzle, here's where **water** is located: **water:7** (The fan of quad-bikes is driving the subway (from 7), so water must be in the position corresponding to OJ or W since both MILK and C are already assigned. From 12 we know that DB drinks orange-juice, so OJ cannot be water. Therefore, **water:7**)

Here's a full solution if you want it:

- M: English - motorbike
- B: Coffee drinker - bus
- S: Ship driver - (assigned later)
- Q: Fan of quad-bikes - subway
- K: Quad-bike driver - (assigned later)
- E: English
- SPA: Spanish - singing
- UKR: Ukrainian - tea drinker
- NOR: Norwegian - leftmost position (from 9)
- JP: Japanese - rock fan
- HH: Writing hobby - fan of hip-hop (from 6)
- TR: Trance fan - left or right of photography (from 10, 11)
- DB: Orange-juice drinker - d&b fan (from 12)
- C: Coffee drinker - bus driver (from 3)
- T: Tea drinker - Ukrainian (from 4)
- MILK: Middle position (from 8)
- OJ: Not water (from the solution above) and not subway driver (since the fan of quad-bikes is driving it).
- W: Water - subway driver (from the solution above)
- SG: Spanish - singing (given in the puzzle)
- P: Photography hobbyist - (assigned later)
- BG: Board-games hobbyist - (assigned later)
- F: Fishing hobbyist - (assigned later)
- WR: Writing hobbyist - fan of hip-hop (from 6).

Now we have all the given facts and additional deductions. Let's find the remaining positions:

1. The English is driving a motorbike, so K cannot be English. K is also not NOR, JP, E or SPA since they are already assigned. So, K must be UKR (the only unassigned nationality).
2. Since K cannot be the subway driver and SPA is singing, S must be the only remaining option for the subway driver.
3. NOR is leftmost, so P must be either to the left of or right of NOR. If P were on the left, it would violate the rule that DB is to the left or right of P (since we know D is UKR and U is not to the left of NOR). Therefore, P must be on the right of NOR, and F must be on the left since there's only one position left.
4. Since K cannot be SPA or E, both SG and BG can only go in the remaining positions: WR (since it is not C, T, MILK, OJ or W) and P or F. However, if P were the person driving the subway (Q), it would violate the rule that DB is to the left of P since SPA is on the left of K (UKR) in this scenario. So, BG must be driving the subway (Q).
5. This leaves P as the photography hobbyist, and F as the fishing hobbyist. TR is then on the other side of P. Since both HH and DB are already assigned to positions 6 and 12, respectively, TR can only go in position 4 or 8 (since C, T, MILK, OJ, W, E and SPA are all assigned). But if TR were in position 8, it would violate the rule that milk is in the middle. So, TR must be in position 4, and therefore P is on the left of UKR (position 3) and F is on the right of NOR (position 5), making W the water drinker in position 7 (as already explained above).

So the final arrangement is as follows:

1. Quad-bike - K (Ukrainian)
2. Subway - BG (board-games hobbyist, Norwegian)
3. Photography - P (Spanish)
4. Trance - TR (Norwegian or Japanese)
5. Fishing - F (English or Japanese)
6. Hip-hop - WR (writing hobbyist, English)
7. Water - W (subway driver, subway beverage)
8. Milk - MILK
9. Norwegian
10. Tea - T (Ukrainian)
11. Bus - C (coffee drinker, Spanish or Japanese)
12. Orange-juice - DB (d&b fan, Japanese)
13. Motorbike - E (English)
14. Rock - JP (Japanese)
15. Singing - SPA (Spanish)"	water:1
Zebra_3domain_replacements_0	" This puzzle requires a systematic approach to solve it. Let's start by determining the positions and nationalities of people based on the given conditions.

1. English drives the motorbike, so the English is position 1 (Motorbike).
2. Spanish sings, so Spanish is in position 6 (Singing). However, since the English is already placed, there must be another person who also has a hobby of singing, which means there are at least two people with the same hobby (Singers have not been assigned unique positions yet).
3. Coffee drinker drives the bus, so position 3 is the coffee drinker (Bus). However, we don't know the nationality of this person yet.
4. Ukrainian drinks tea, so position 4 is Ukrainian (Tea).
5. Bus driver is to the right of Ship driver; since positions 1-4 are taken, position 5 (Ship) must have the ship driver. Now we can place the bus driver next to the ship driver on the right, which makes position 6 (Bus) the coffee drinker (we already know that this person's nationality is unknown).
6. Hip-hop fan writes, so position 7 (Writing) is a hip-hop fan. Since positions 1-6 are taken, position 8 (Water) is a possible candidate for the hip-hop fan. We don't have enough information to assign this person yet.
7. Quad-bike driver is Subway driver, so position 9 (Subway) is the quad-bike driver. However, we don't know which nationality or hobby this person has yet.
8. Milk drinker is in the middle, so position 5 (Milk) cannot be the English, Ukrainian, nor Norwegian since they are all placed on other positions. The only remaining option is that the milk drinker is Japanese (Rock), which leaves position 8 as the milk drinker (Milk).
9. Norwegian is on the far left, so position 1 (Norway) must be the Norwegian.
10. Trance fan is either to the left or right of photography hobbyist; since positions 1-4 are taken and we know that there are at least two people with the same hobby (Singers), we can't assign trance fan yet. However, based on the available information, position 2 (Spanish) could be a candidate for the trance fan if there is another person with the hobby of singing nearby.
11. Quad-bike driver is either to the left or right of fishing hobbyist; since positions 1-6 are taken and we know that there are at least two people with the same hobby (Singers), we can't assign quad-bike driver yet. However, based on the available information, position 9 (Subway) could be a candidate for the quad-bike driver if there is another person with the hobby of fishing nearby.
12. D&B fan drinks orange-juice, so position 10 (Orange-juice) is the d&b fan.
13. Japanese is the rock fan, which was already placed at position 8 (Rock).
14. Norwegian is to the left or right of quad-bike driver; since positions 1-6 are taken and we know that there are at least two people with the same hobby (Singers), we can't assign Norwegian yet based on the available information. However, based on the given conditions, position 9 (Subway) could be a candidate for the Norwegian if there is another person with the hobby of fishing nearby.

Now let's try to find the remaining positions and their corresponding characteristics:
- Singers have not been placed yet; one possibility is that positions 2 (Spanish) and 6 (Singing) are both singers, but we still need to determine their nationalities, hobbies, and beverages. One option could be Spanish is the trance fan and drinks tea (positions 2 and 4), or another possibility could be that English is a singer and drinks coffee (position 3).
- Board-games is not placed yet; since positions 1-10 are taken, board-games must be in position 11. However, without knowing the hobbies of other people, it's impossible to determine the nationality or beverage of the person with the hobby of playing board games (Board-games).

In summary, the final positions look like this:

- Position 1 (Motorbike): English/Singer/Coffee
- Position 2 (Singing): Spanish/Singer/Tea or Trance fan
- Position 3 (Bus): Unknown nationality/Coffee drinker
- Position 4 (Tea): Ukrainian
- Position 5 (Ship): Unknown
- Position 6 (Singing): English/Singer/Coffee or Spanish
- Position 7 (Writing): Hip-hop fan/Unknown nationality
- Position 8 (Water): Japanese/Rock fan/Milk
- Position 9 (Subway): Quad-bike driver/Unknown nationality
- Position 10 (Orange-juice): D&B fan
- Position 11 (Board-games): Unknown nationality/Unknown beverage"	board-games:5
Zebra_3domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step. We will assign numbers (1-5) to represent each person based on their birthdays from earliest to latest:

1. May - Person 1 (P1) drives the quad-bike
2. January - Person 2 (P2) travels to Hannover
3. July - Person 3 (P3) is to the right of P2
4. June - P4 smokes kools and owns a dog (which is driven by P2) so must be on the other side of P2, let's say left.
5. September - Person 5 (P5) is to the right of P3.

Now let's place the remaining people based on their relationships with previously placed ones:

- Since the van driver travels to Berlin and P4 is already on the left side, P4 can't drive the van; therefore, P5 must drive the van (P5 → V). This means that P1, P2, and P3 are left.

- The chesterfields-smoker (C) cannot be in the middle because P4 is already there and C must be either to the left or right of the fox owner (F). Since P3 can't be C due to C being on the other side of F, P1 must be C.

- The lucky-strike-smoker (LS) travels to Colone, so LS must be P2 because P5 is already assigned to V. Now we know that P4 smokes kools and owns a dog, so they can't travel to Venice since only the middle spot remains, which means P1 travels to Venice.

- The helicopter driver (H) cannot be on the far left because the skateboard rider is the parliaments-smoker (PS), and PS must be placed after C. Since H is also to the right of P3, H can only go in the two remaining spots: 4 or 5. However, placing H in either position would disrupt the transport arrangement for the remaining people, so there's a contradiction here; thus, this puzzle has an inconsistency and cannot be solved.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine Hamburg's location based on the given information due to the inconsistency found during the analysis."	hamburg:1
Zebra_3domain_replacements_1	" To solve this puzzle, we need to create a system to organize the information and find consistent positions for each character. Here's an organized version of the problem based on transport and city first, then pets, birthdays, and cigars.

1. Transport & City:
   - Quad-bike (May): Hannover
   - Ship (Dog owner): Berlin
   - Van (January): Unknown
   - Helicopter (Far left): Unknown
   - Skateboard (Parliaments-smoker): Unknown
   - (Van driver) (Berlin traveler): Berline-4
   - (Helicopter driver) (City unknown): Unknown-#
   - Quad-bike (May owner): Hannover-1
   - Ship driver (Dog owner): Berlin-2
   - Skateboard driver (Parliaments-smoker): Unknown-3

2. Pets:
   - Dog owner (Ship driver) = Berlin-2
   - Zebra owner (Unknown): Unknown-#
   - Fox owner (On the left or right of Chesterfields-smoker): Unknown-A
   - Horse owner (Kools-smoker is to the left or right of) : Unknown-B
   - Snails owner (Old-gold-smoker): Unknown-C

3. Birthdays:
   - May birthday (Quad-bike driver): Hannover-1
   - January birthday (City traveler, on the left of July birthday): Unknown-D
   - June birthday (Kools-smoker): Unknown-G
   - July birthday (On the right of January birthday): Unknown-E
   - September birthday (Unknown): Unknown-F

4. Cigars:
   - Old-gold smoker (Snails owner): Unknown-C
   - Kools smoker (June birthday, left or right of horse owner): Unknown-G
   - Chesterfields smoker (On the left or right of fox owner): Unknown-A
   - Lucky-strike smoker (City traveler to Colone): Unknown-#
   - Parisments smoker (Skateboard driver): Unknown-3

Now let's solve some parts based on our organized information:

1. We know the quad-bike owner lives in Hannover, so that's our starting point. The person who's birthday is in May owns a quad-bike, and we already know they live in Hannover, so Hannover-1 is the May-born quad-bike driver.
2. Since the ship driver is also the dog owner, and the dog owner lives in Berlin, the person driving the ship (Berlin-2) must travel from Berlin.
3. We have now learned that January birthday is on the left of July's birthday. As we know Hannover-1 already occupies a spot, let's assign ""1"" to the leftmost open position and add new numbers based on the given condition. So, we get:
   - Unknown-D (January birthday) ≤ Unknown-E (July birthday)
4. Now we can find out who smokes Old-gold since the old-gold smoker owns snails. We know the positions of the January and July birthdays; so if the snails owner is to the right of the July-born, then they must be between E & C or F & C as there are no other open spots between them. Let's assign ""C"" to the person who smokes old-gold since we have only two remaining options in this situation.

Now let's continue with our organized table and update the information based on these findings:

1. Transport & City:
   - Quad-bike (May): Hannover-1
   - Ship (Dog owner, Berlin traveler): Berlin-2
   - Van (January): Unknown
   - Helicopter (Far left): Unknown
   - Skateboard (Parliaments-smoker): Unknown
   - (Van driver) (Berlin traveler): Berline-4
   - (Helicopter driver) (City unknown): Unknown-#
   - Quad-bike (May owner): Hannover-1
   - Ship driver (Dog owner): Berlin-2
   - Skateboard driver (Parliaments-smoker): Unknown-3

2. Pets:
   - Dog owner (Ship driver) = Berlin-2
   - Zebra owner (Unknown): Unknown-#
   - Fox owner (On the left or right of Chesterfields-smoker): Unknown-A
   - Horse owner (Kools-smoker is to the left or right of) : Unknown-B
   - Snails owner (Old-gold-smoker): Hannover-C

3. Birthdays:
   - May birthday (Quad-bike driver): Hannover-1
   - January birthday (Left of July's birthday): Unknown-D
   - June birthday (Kools-smoker, left or right of horse owner): Unknown-G
   - July birthday (Right of January's birthday): Unknown-E
   - September birthday (Unknown): Unknown-F

4. Cigars:
   - Old-gold smoker (Snails owner): Hannover-C
   - Kools smoker (June birthday, left or right of horse owner): Unknown-G
   - Chesterfields smoker (On the left or right of fox owner): Unknown-A
   - Lucky-strike smoker (City traveler to Colone): Unknown-#
   - Parisments smoker (Skateboard driver): Unknown-3

Now we need to find positions for the rest of the characters using the given clues. It will be a complex process, but I'll spare you the details here and present you with the solution:

1. Transport & City:
   - Quad-bike (May): Hannover-1
   - Ship (Dog owner, Berlin traveler): Berlin-2
   - Van (January): Venice-4
   - Helicopter (Far left): Colone-9
   - Skateboard (Parliaments-smoker): Hamburg-3
   - (Van driver) (Berlin traveler): Berline-4
   - (Helicopter driver) (City unknown): Unknown-#

2. Pets:
   - Dog owner (Ship driver) = Berlin-2
   - Zebra owner (Unknown, left or right of Lucky-strike smoker): Colone-F
   - Fox owner (On the left or right of Chesterfields-smoker): Unknown-A
   - Horse owner (Kools-smoker is to the left or right of) : Hamburg-B
   - Snails owner (Old-gold-smoker): Hannover-C

3. Birthdays:
   - May birthday (Quad-bike driver): Hannover-1
   - January birthday (Left of July's birthday): Venice-D
   - June birthday (Kools-smoker, left or right of horse owner): Hamburg-G
   - July birthday (Right of January's birthday): Unknown-E
   - September birthday (Unknown): Unknown-F

4. Cigars:
   - Old-gold smoker (Snails owner): Hannover-C
   - Kools smoker (June birthday, left or right of horse owner): Hamburg-G
   - Chesterfields smoker (On the left or right of fox owner): Unknown-A
   - Lucky-strike smoker (City traveler to Colone): Colone-#
   - Parisments smoker (Skateboard driver): Hamburg-3

Now you can see that Zebra's owner is at Colone-F. As we have only one open spot there, we are done."	zebra:5
Zebra_3domain_replacements_2	" To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. From clue #9, we know that the norwegian is on the far left, so we can assign positions to the other nationalities from left to right: Japanese, Norwegian (far left), Ukrainian, [empty], English (far right).
2. Since the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the person playing domino, and the norwegian is to its left, we can assign basketball (domino player) to a position between the norwegian and the kools-smoker. So our lineup is now: Japanese, Norwegian, [empty], Basketball, English, Kools-smoker
3. Clue #7 tells us that the kools-smoker is the person playing baseball, so we can assign baseball to the position after basketball (the last empty position). So our lineup is now: Japanese, Norwegian, Basketball, Baseball, English
4. From clue #12, we know that the lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's birthday is in September. Since there are no more empty positions to assign, we can place lucky-strike-smoker between two existing persons: Japanese and Norwegian (far left). So our lineup is now: Japanese, Lucky-strike, Norwegian, Basketball, Baseball, English
5. Clue #6 tells us that the old-gold-smoker is the person playing snooker. Since there are no more empty positions to assign, we can place old-gold-smoker between two existing persons: Basketball and Kools-smoker (the last position). So our lineup is now: Japanese, Lucky-strike, Norwegian, Snooker, Basketball, Kools, Baseball, English
6. From clue #5, we know that the ice-hockey player is to the right of the basketball player. Since they are already assigned positions (Basketball and Ice-hockey), we can place them according to this condition: Snooker, Basketball, Ice-hockey, [empty], Baseball, English
7. The only remaining position ([empty]) must belong to the person playing surfing since there are 5 different sports, and all other sports have been assigned already. So our final lineup is: Japanese, Lucky-strike, Norwegian, Snooker, Ice-hockey, Surfing, Basketball, Kools, Baseball, English
8. From clue #3, we know that the person who's birthday is in March is the person playing ice-hockey, so March must be the position of ice-hockey, which is the third from the left: Ice-hockey (March).
9. To find August, we look for the fifth person from the right since there are 5 different birthdays and all have been assigned positions in our final lineup. Counting from right to left, we find that the person in the fifth position is the English, so August must be the month of the English's birthday: English (August).
10. Therefore, the answer for your puzzle is: August:5"	august:1
Zebra_3domain_replacements_2	" To solve this logic puzzle, let's create a table with the given information and find the missing pieces:

| Position | Nationality    | Sport     | Cigar      | Birthday  | Game          |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | T         | Chesterfield   | May      | Billiard/D  |
| 2        | English      | Cycling  | Old-gold    | Unknown  | Snooker/S    |
| 3        | Spanish     | U         | Kools       | Unknown  | Poker/A       |
| 4        | Ukrainian   | IHockey   | Lucky-strike| December | Unknown      |
| 5        | Unknown     | Basketball| Parliaments | Unknown  | Unknown      |
| 6        | Unknown     | Ice-hockey| Unknown    | March    | Unknown      |
| 7        | Unknown     | Baseball  | Kools       | Unknown  | Unknown      |
| 8        | Unknown     | Unknown   | Unknown    | May      | Backgammon/B|
| 9        | Japanese    | Surfing  | Parliaments | Unknown  | Unknown      |

With the given clues, we can fill in some of the empty cells:
- The norwegian is on the far left (Position 1), so position 9 must be the japanese.
- Position 2 is the english and plays cycling (T).
- Position 3 is the spanish and plays poker (A).
- The ukranian is the person who's birthday is in december (Position 4), so that means position 6 must be ice-hockey.
- Since the ukranian is to the right of the person playing basketball, the english cannot play basketball (T), and hence the position 5 is basketball.
- The old-gold-smoker is the person playing snooker (S2).
- The kools-smoker is the person who's sport is baseball (Position 7).
- Since the norwegian is to the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing, the japanese cannot play surfing (Position 9). Therefore, position 4 must be surfing.
- The lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's birthday is in september (8).
- Since the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the person playing domino, neither the english nor japanese can play domino. So the spanish and ukranian are possible candidates for Position 3, but since there's a poker player already in position 3, it means that the spanish plays poker and the ukranian plays domino (Position 10).
- Since the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the person playing billiard, the only possible positions for the chesterfields-smoker are 1, 5, and 9. But we already know that 1 and 9 have been taken by norwegian (T) and japanese (S), so it means that position 5 must be chesterfields-smoker.
- Since position 2 is the english and plays cycling (T), and position 6 has ice-hockey, which is to the right of basketball, it indicates that Position 8 is the only remaining empty position in between positions 2 and 6. Therefore, Position 8 must be May (B) and play Backgammon.

The final table is:

| Position | Nationality    | Sport     | Cigar      | Birthday  | Game          |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | T         | Chesterfield   | May      | Billiard/D  |
| 2        | English      | Cycling  | Old-gold    | Unknown  | Snooker/S    |
| 3        | Spanish     | Poker    | Kools       | Unknown  | A             |
| 4        | Ukrainian   | Surfing  | Lucky-strike| December | IHockey       |
| 5        | English     | Basketball| Parliaments | Unknown  | Chesterfield/B|
| 6        | Spanish    | Ice-hockey| Unknown    | March    | Unknown      |
| 7        | Japanese    | Baseball  | Kools       | Unknown  | Unknown      |
| 8        | May         | Backgammon| Unknown    | August   | Unknown      |
| 9        | Japanese    | Surfing  | Parliaments | Unknown  | Unknown      |

So the answer is **backgammon:8**."	backgammon:5
