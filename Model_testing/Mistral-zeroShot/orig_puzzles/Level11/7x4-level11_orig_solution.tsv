Now let's use the clues to fill in the table:

|               |      1      |        2        |     3      |      4      |
| Beverage      |             |                 |            |             |
| Hobby         |             |                 |            |             |
| Job           |             |                 |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   |             |                 |            |             |
| Music-Genre   |             |                 |            |             |

| Transport     |             |                 |            |             |

From clues 13 and 27, we know that 7up and Fantasy are in positions 4 and 3, respectively. From clue 3, Coffee is either to the left or right of 7up, so Coffee can be in position 1 or 2. Since the person drinking coffee is watching musical movies (clue 8), we can assign Coffee to position 1 (Musical in position 2 would violate clue 16).

Now we know that 7up, Coffee, and Musical are in positions 4, 1, and 2, respectively. From clue 14, the accountant is on the left of 7up, so the accountant is in position 3.

From clue 15, the person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the nigerian, so time-travel movies must be in position 1. Since the accountant is in position 3, the nigerian must be in position 4.

From clue 19, the person who's hobby is writing and the coach have different parity positions. Since the accountant (writing) is in position 3, the coach must be in position 2.

From clue 5, the canadian is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. Since the coach (satire) is in position 2, the canadian can be in position 1 or 3. However, if the canadian were in position 1, it would violate clue 16 (iced-tea and the australian have different parity positions). So the canadian must be in position 3.

From clue 12, the australian is the coach or the australian is the person driving the skateboard, but not both. Since the coach is already in position 2, the australian must be driving the skateboard, so skateboard is in position 4.

From clue 10, the fan disco is the nigerian or the fan disco is the person who's hobby is hiking or both. Since the nigerian is already in position 4, the fan disco must be the person who's hobby is hiking, so hiking is in position 1.

From clue 2, the fan hip-hop is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the nigerian (disco) is in position 4 and the hiking person is in position 1, the fan hip-hop cannot be in position 2 or 3. So the fan hip-hop must be in position 4.

From clue 4, the turkish is the fan hip-hop or the fan hip-hop is the person who's hobby is sudoku, but not both. Since the fan hip-hop is already in position 4, the turkish must be the person who's hobby is sudoku, so sudoku is in position 3.

From clue 6, the person driving the trike is the person drinking juice or the person driving the trike is the person who's hobby is video-games or both. Since the australian (skateboard) is in position 4, the trike cannot be in position 4. Since the fan hip-hop (turkish) is in position 4, the trike cannot be in position 3. So the trike must be in position 1, and the person who's hobby is video-games is in position 2.

From clue 22, the person driving the skateboard is the fan hip-hop or the person driving the skateboard is the project-manager or both. Since the australian (skateboard) is already in position 4, the fan hip-hop cannot be in position 4. So the project-manager must be in position 4.

From clue 20, the project-manager is on the left or right of the fan metal. Since the project-manager is already in position 4, the fan metal must be in position 1 or 2. However, if the fan metal were in position 1, it would violate clue 17 (the accountant is the fan blues or the accountant is the fan metal, but not both). So the fan metal must be in position 2.

From clue 25, the fan hip-hop is the person drinking iced-tea or the person who's hobby is sudoku is the fan hip-hop, but not both. Since the fan hip-hop is already in position 4, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1.

From clue 26, the australian is the coach or the person who's hobby is sudoku is the australian or both. Since the coach is already in position 2, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be the australian, so sudoku is in position 3.

From clue 9, the person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the left of the nigerian. Since the nigerian is in position 4 and the person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 3, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 2.

From clue 23, the person watching fantasy movies and the person driving the subway have different parity positions. Since the person driving the skateboard (australian) is in position 4 and the person watching fantasy movies is in position 3, the person driving the subway must be in position 1.

From clue 24, the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the person driving the skateboard is already in position 4, the person watching satire movies must be in position 1 or 2. However, if the person watching satire movies were in position 1, it would violate clue 5 (the canadian is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies). So the person watching satire movies must be in position 2.

From clue 18, the person watching fantasy movies and the accountant have different parity positions. Since the accountant is in position 3 and the person watching fantasy movies is in position 2, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 1.

From clue 16, the person drinking iced-tea and the australian have different parity positions. Since the australian is in position 4 and the person watching time-travel movies is in position 1, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2 or 3. However, if the person drinking iced-tea were in position 2, it would violate clue 2 (the fan hip-hop is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea). So the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3.

From clue 11, the person driving the subway is not the person drinking juice. Since the person driving the subway is already in position 1, the person drinking juice must be in position 2, 3, or 4. However, if the person drinking juice were in position 2, it would violate clue 6 (the person driving the trike is the person drinking juice or the person driving the trike is the person who's hobby is video-games or both). So the person drinking juice must be in position 4.

From clue 7, the fan hip-hop is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is already in position 1, the fan hip-hop must be in position 2 or 3. However, if the fan hip-hop were in position 2, it would violate clue 2 (the fan hip-hop is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea). So the fan hip-hop must be in position 3.

From clue 1, the person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is already in position 2, the person driving the subway must be in position 3 or 4. However, if the person driving the subway were in position 4, it would violate clue 13 (the person drinking 7up is on the far right). So the person driving the subway must be in position 3.

Now we have filled in the table:

Now let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. From clue 1, we know that A or L = T. Since A and L cannot be the same (clue 5), A = T and L ≠ T.
2. From clue 2, we know that S ≠ A and S ≠ R. Since A = T, S ≠ T.
3. From clue 3, we know that S < M.
4. From clue 4, we know that Qb = B.

11. From clue 11, we know that T > K.
12. From clue 12, we know that A > T. Since C > A, T cannot be D.
13. From clue 13, we know that M > C.
14. From clue 14, we know that S = T.
15. From clue 15, we know that Lz = A or Lz = D. Since B and A or B and D have the same parity, Lz cannot be A. So Lz = D.
16. From clue 16, we know that T ≠ L.
17. From clue 17, we know that A > Tr. Since T > K, Tr cannot be D.
18. From clue 18, we know that M < Mb.
19. From clue 19, we know that F and T have the same parity. Since F cannot be A or D (clue 7), F = C.
20. From clue 20, we know that S < V.
21. From clue 21, we know that E > P.
22. From clue 22, we know that R = M or R = T or R = M and T. Since R = T (clue 14), R = T.
23. From clue 23, we know that Tr < M.
24. From clue 24, we know that T = C or T = S or T = C and S. Since T = S (clue 14), T = S.
25. From clue 25, we know that Mb > T.
26. From clue 26, we know that T = P or Gf = P or T = P and Gf = P. Since T = S (clue 14), Gf = P.
27. From clue 27, we know that T > Tr.
28. From clue 28, we know that T ≠ F.
29. From clue 29, we know that A < T < C or C < T < A. Since T = S (clue 14), C < S < A.

Lv11-7x4-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the given information to variables and using the given clues to make deductions.

Let's use the following variables:
- Beverage: I (iced-tea), L (lemonade), M (milk), S (sprite)
- Hobby: C (chess), P (puzzles), R (rock-climbing), V (video-games)
- Job: D (dancer), F (fisherman), P (paramedic), S (scientist)

- Sport: B (baseball), C (cycling), L (lacrosse), R (rugby)
- Transport: A (airplane), B (bike), B (boat), T (train)

Let's start with the positions:
- The person drinking iced-tea is in an even position (1, 3, or 5)
- The italian is in an odd position (2, 3, or 4)

Now let's use the given clues:
1. The person drinking iced-tea is in position 4
2. The italian is not the person drinking lemonade or driving the bike
3. The person driving the airplane is the dancer or the dancer is the fan country or both (D = I or D = C or D = I and C = C)
4. The person who's hobby is chess is not the person driving the boat
5. The scientist is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite
6. The paramedic is not to the right of the american
7. The scientist is somewhere to the right of the person drinking iced-tea
8. The person driving the airplane is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing
9. The american and the person who's sport is cycling have the same parity positions
10. The dancer is the person who's hobby is video-games or the person who's hobby is video-games is the person drinking sprite or both
11. The person who's hobby is chess is not the person who's sport is cycling
12. The person drinking lemonade is not the dancer
13. The person who's sport is cycling is the person who's hobby is chess or the dancer is the person who's sport is cycling
14. The italian is on the right of the fan rock
15. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan metal
16. The person drinking lemonade is the fan electronic
17. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing
18. The paramedic and the fan electronic have the same parity positions
19. The fan rock is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite
20. The fan rock is the person driving the airplane or the person driving the airplane is the person who's sport is rugby or both
21. The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse
22. The person drinking lemonade is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the person drinking lemonade is the scientist, but not both
23. The person who's hobby is chess is not to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse
24. The american is not to the right of the fisherman
25. The person drinking sprite is the fan metal or the person who's hobby is puzzles is the person drinking sprite, but not both
26. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the italian
27. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the italian
28. The malaysian is not to the right of the person drinking milk
29. The american is not to the left of the chinese
30. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the scientist

Now let's start solving the puzzle:

From clue 1, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 4. Since the italian is in an odd position, the italian cannot be in position 4. So, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 4 (L = I).

From clue 2, the italian is not the person driving the bike. Since the italian is not in position 4, the person driving the bike must be in position 1 (B = A).

From clue 3, the person driving the airplane is the dancer or the dancer is the fan country or both. Since the person driving the bike is the american (A), the dancer cannot be the american (D ≠ A). So, the dancer must be the fan country (C = D).

From clue 5, the scientist is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking lemonade is the italian (I), the scientist cannot be to the left of the person drinking lemonade (I). So, the scientist must be to the right of the person drinking lemonade (S > I).

From clue 6, the paramedic is not to the right of the american. Since the person driving the bike is the american (A), the paramedic cannot be in position 3 or 4 (P ≠ 3, P ≠ 4). So, the paramedic must be in position 1 or 2 (P = 1 or P = 2).

From clue 7, the scientist is somewhere to the right of the person drinking iced-tea (S > 4). Since the scientist is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade (I), the scientist must be in position 3 (S = 3).

From clue 8, the person driving the airplane is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the dancer is the fan country (C = D) and the person driving the bike is the american (A), the person who's hobby is rock-climbing cannot be the american (R ≠ A). So, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in position 2 (R = 2).

From clue 9, the american and the person who's sport is cycling have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the bike is the american (A), the person who's sport is cycling must be the american (C = C).

From clue 10, the dancer is the person who's hobby is video-games or the person who's hobby is video-games is the person drinking sprite or both. Since the dancer is the fan country (C = D), the person drinking sprite cannot be the dancer (S ≠ D). So, the person who's hobby is video-games must be the person drinking sprite (V = S).

From clue 11, the person who's hobby is chess is not the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's sport is cycling is the american (C = C), the person who's hobby is chess cannot be the american (C ≠ C). So, the person who's hobby is chess must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (C = 1, C = 2, or C = 3).

From clue 12, the person drinking lemonade is not the dancer (I ≠ D). Since the dancer is the fan country (C = D), the person drinking lemonade cannot be the fan country (I ≠ C). So, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (I = 1, I = 2, or I = 3).

From clue 13, the person who's sport is cycling is the person who's hobby is chess or the dancer is the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's hobby is chess is not the american (C ≠ C), the person who's hobby is chess must be the person who's sport is cycling (C = C). So, the dancer is not the person who's sport is cycling (D ≠ C).

From clue 14, the italian is on the right of the fan rock. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = I), the fan rock must be in position 1 or 2 (R = 1 or R = 2).

From clue 15, the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan metal. Since the person drinking lemonade is the italian (I = 1, I = 2, or I = 3), the fan metal must be in position 2 or 4 (M = 2 or M = 4).

From clue 16, the person drinking lemonade is the fan electronic. Since the person drinking lemonade is the italian (I = 1, I = 2, or I = 3), the fan electronic must be the italian (E = I).

From clue 17, the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (I > R). Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = I), the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in position 1 (R = 1).

From clue 18, the paramedic and the fan electronic have the same parity positions. Since the fan electronic is the italian (E = I), the paramedic must be in position 3 (P = 3).

From clue 19, the fan rock is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite (R < S). Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = I), the person drinking sprite must be in position 2 or 4 (S = 2 or S = 4).

From clue 20, the fan rock is the person driving the airplane or the person driving the airplane is the person who's sport is rugby or both. Since the fan rock is the italian (R = I), the person driving the airplane cannot be the italian (A ≠ I). So, the person driving the airplane must be the person who's sport is rugby (R = A or R = R). Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = I), the person who's sport is rugby cannot be the italian (R ≠ I). So, the person driving the airplane is the person who's sport is rugby (R = R).

From clue 21, the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = I), the person who's sport is baseball cannot be the italian (B ≠ I). So, the person who's sport is baseball must be in position 1 or 3 (B = 1 or B = 3). Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = I), the person who's sport is lacrosse cannot be the italian (L ≠ I). So, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 2 or 4 (L = 2 or L = 4).

From clue 22, the person drinking lemonade is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the person drinking lemonade is the scientist, but not both. Since the person drinking lemonade is the italian (I = 1, I = 2, or I = 3), the person who's hobby is rock-climbing cannot be the italian (R ≠ I). So, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in position 2 (R = 2). Since the person drinking lemonade is the italian (I = 1, I = 2, or I = 3), the scientist cannot be the italian (S ≠ I). So, the scientist must be in position 3 (S = 3).

From clue 23, the person who's hobby is chess is not to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = 2) and the person who's sport is lacrosse is not the italian (L ≠ I), the person who's hobby is chess cannot be in position 4 (C ≠ 4). So, the person who's hobby is chess must be in position 1 or 3 (C = 1 or C = 3).

From clue 24, the american is not to the right of the fisherman. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = 2) and the person who's sport is lacrosse is not the italian (L ≠ I), the person who's hobby is chess cannot be the american (C ≠ A). So, the person who's hobby is chess must be in position 1 (C = 1). Since the person who's hobby is chess is not the american (C ≠ A), the fisherman cannot be the american (F ≠ A). So, the fisherman must be in position 3 (F = 3).

From clue 25, the person drinking sprite is the fan metal or the person who's hobby is puzzles is the person drinking sprite, but not both. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the italian (R = 2) and the person who's hobby is chess is the american (C = 1), the person who's hobby is puzzles cannot be the american (P ≠ A). So, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in position 4 (P = 4). Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is not the person drinking sprite (P ≠ S), the person drinking sprite must be in position 1 or 3 (S = 1 or S = 3).

From clue 26, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the italian. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 4 (P = 4), the italian must be in position 3 (I = 3).

From clue 27, the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the italian. Since the italian is in position 3 (I = 3), the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 4 (L = 4).

From clue 28, the malaysian is not to the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 4 (P = 4), the malaysian cannot be in position 4 (M ≠ 4). So, the malaysian must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (M = 1, M = 2, or M = 3).

From clue 29, the american is not to the left of the chinese. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 4 (P = 4), the chinese cannot be in position 4 (C ≠ 4). So, the chinese must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (C = 1, C = 2, or C = 3). Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 4 (P = 4), the american cannot be in position 4 (A ≠ 4). So, the american must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (A = 1, A = 2, or A = 3).

From clue 30, the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the scientist. Since the scientist is in position 3 (S = 3), the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 1 or 4 (L = 1 or L = 4).

Lv11-7x4-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and I'll try to solve it step by step. Let's denote the positions with numbers from 1 to 4, with 1 being the leftmost position and 4 being the rightmost position.

1. We know that there are 4 different nationalities, so each nationality must occupy a unique position. Let's assume the nationalities are in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. From rule 18, the person drinking 7up is not in position 4 (since the coach can't be in position 4, and the coach can't drink 7up). So, the person drinking 7up is in positions 1, 2, or 3.

3. From rule 16, the person owning the goldfish drinks 7up. So, the person owning the goldfish is in positions 1, 2, or 3.

4. From rule 19, the person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since the nationalities are already assigned, the only possible positions for these two are (1,2) and (2,3). If they are in (1,2), the documentary watcher is the person in position 1, and the thriller watcher is in position 2. If they are in (2,3), the documentary watcher is in position 2, and the thriller watcher is in position 3.

5. From rule 14, the person watching disaster movies is not the nigerian. Since the nationalities are already assigned, the person watching disaster movies can't be in position 4 (as the nigerian is in position 3). So, the person watching disaster movies is in positions 1, 2, or 3.

6. From rule 20, the person drinking 7up is the coach or the person watching disaster movies is the coach. Since the person watching disaster movies is already placed, the person drinking 7up must be the coach. So, the coach is in position 1 (drinking 7up), and the person watching disaster movies is in positions 2, 3, or 4.

7. From rule 24, the person watching disaster movies is not the nigerian. So, the person watching disaster movies is in positions 2, 3, or 4, and the nigerian is in position 1, 2, or 3.

8. From rule 11, the manager is on the left or right of the owner of the frog. Since the coach is in position 1, the manager can't be in position 1. So, the manager is in positions 2, 3, or 4.

9. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the nigerian. Since the nigerian is in positions 1, 2, or 3, the person who's hobby is video-games is in positions 2, 3, or 4.

10. From rule 23, the person who's hobby is singing is the french or the person who's hobby is singing is the fan r&b or both. Since we already know the nationalities, the person who's hobby is singing must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

11. From rule 21, the fan salsa is the person drinking tea or the fan salsa is the japanese, but not both. Since we know the person drinking tea is in positions 2, 3, or 4, and the japanese is in positions 1, 2, or 3, the fan salsa can't be the person drinking tea and can't be the japanese. So, the fan salsa is in positions 1, 2, or 4 (not 3).

12. From rule 22, the fan salsa is on the far right. So, the fan salsa is in position 4.

13. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is video-games is the accountant or the fan salsa is the person who's hobby is video-games or both. Since we know the fan salsa is in position 4, the person who's hobby is video-games is in positions 1, 2, or 3.

14. From rule 25, the colombian and the fan punk have different parity positions. Since we know the nationalities, the colombian is in positions 1, 3, or 5, and the fan punk is in positions 2, 4, or 6.

15. From rule 15, the person drinking tea is in an even position. Since we know the person drinking tea is in positions 2, 3, or 4, the person drinking tea is in position 2 or 4.

16. From rule 17, the japanese and the person who's hobby is chess have different parity positions. Since we know the nationalities, the japanese is in positions 1, 3, or 5, and the person who's hobby is chess is in positions 2, 4, or 6.

17. From rule 1, the nigerian is not to the left of the mechanic. Since the nigerian is in positions 1, 2, or 3, the mechanic is in positions 2, 3, or 4.

18. From rule 3, the mechanic is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the mechanic is in positions 2, 3, or 4, the owner of the guinea-pig is in positions 1, 3, or 4.

19. From rule 12, the person drinking tea is somewhere between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the goldfish. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in positions 1, 3, or 4, and the person drinking tea is in positions 2, 3, or 4, the person drinking tea is in position 3.

20. From rule 7, the mechanic and the owner of the mouse have the same parity positions. Since the mechanic is in positions 2, 3, or 4, the owner of the mouse is also in positions 2, 3, or 4.

21. From rule 8, the owner of the mouse is the person who's hobby is photography or the owner of the mouse is the person watching musical movies, but not both. Since the person watching musical movies is in positions 1, 2, or 3, the owner of the mouse can't be in position 1 (as the person watching musical movies can't be the owner of the mouse). So, the owner of the mouse is in positions 2, 3, or 4, and the person watching musical movies is in positions 1, 2, or 3.

22. From rule 9, the fan trance is somewhere to the left of the fan salsa. Since the fan salsa is in position 4, the fan trance is in positions 1, 2, or 3.

23. From rule 5, the owner of the mouse is the person who's hobby is chess or the owner of the mouse is the fan salsa or both. Since we know the owner of the mouse is in positions 2, 3, or 4, and the fan salsa is in position 4, the owner of the mouse can't be the fan salsa. So, the owner of the mouse is the person who's hobby is chess.

24. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is chess is the fan punk. So, the person who's hobby is chess is in position 1 (as the fan punk is in position 1).

25. From rule 2, the manager is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking tea is in position 3, the manager is in position 1 or 2.

26. From rule 4, the person watching thriller movies is the person who's hobby is photography or the person watching thriller movies is the french or both. Since the person watching thriller movies is in positions 1, 2, or 3, and the person who's hobby is photography is in positions 1, 2, or 3, the person watching thriller movies can't be the person who's hobby is photography. So, the person watching thriller movies is the french.

27. From rule 23, the person who's hobby is singing is the french or the person who's hobby is singing is the fan r&b or both. Since we know the person who's hobby is singing is the french, the person who's hobby is singing is in position 1.

28. From rule 20, the person watching disaster movies is the coach or the person watching disaster movies is the fan salsa is the person who's hobby is video-games or both. Since we know the person watching disaster movies is in positions 2, 3, or 4, and the fan salsa is in position 4, the person watching disaster movies can't be the fan salsa. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is in positions 1, 2, or 3, the person watching disaster movies can't be the person who's hobby is video-games. So, the person watching disaster movies is the coach.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |    1     |      2      |      3      |      4      |

This is the final solution table based on the given rules."
Lv11-7x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 people and 4 positions in each row, the same parity positions mean they are in positions 1 and 3, 2 and 4, or 1 and 5 (modulo 2). Let's assign numbers to the positions for easier reference:

   |               |    1     |     2      |      3       |     4     |

Lv11-7x4-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each item in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each item and position.

1. Let A, B, C, D represent the four beverages (almond-milk, hot-chocolate, juice, sprite).
2. Let X, Y, Z, W represent the four foods (artichoke, cherry, peas, potato).
3. Let P, Q, R, S represent the four hobbies (chess, collecting, cooking, singing).
4. Let M, N, O, L represent the four movie-genres (adventure, musical, romance, time-travel).
5. Let G, H, I, J represent the four music-genres (disco, r&b, reggae, rock).
6. Let K, L, M, N represent the four pets (goat, hedgehog, snake, turtle).
7. Let A, B, C, D represent the four sports (basketball, ice-hockey, parkour, skateboarding).

Now let's use the clues to deduce the positions:

4. The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the fan rock (O < G)
5. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the fan reggae (A < H or A > H)
6. The person who's hobby is cooking is the person watching musical movies or the person who's hobby is cooking is the person drinking hot-chocolate or both (R = O or R = D or R = O and D = D)
7. The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies (R < N)
8. The fan disco and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions (G and N have the same parity)
9. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (A > D)
10. The person who's sport is skateboarding and the person eating peas have different parity positions (C and Z have different parity)
11. The person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person eating potato (M > W)
12. The fan disco is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (G < P)
13. The person drinking juice is not the person eating cherry (A ≠ C)
14. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person eating artichoke (D > X)
15. The owner of the turtle and the person who's sport is ice-hockey have the same parity positions (I and B have the same parity)
16. The owner of the snake is not to the left of the person who's sport is parkour (J > C)
17. The fan disco is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (G < B)
18. The person drinking almond-milk is not to the left of the person eating artichoke (B > X)
19. The fan reggae and the person watching musical movies have different parity positions (H and O have different parity)
20. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the fan rock (A > G)
21. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog (I > H)

Lv11-7x4-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, let's use B for beverage, F for food, M for movie-genre, G for music-genre, N for nationality, P for pet, and T for transport. We'll use numbers 1-4 for each category to represent the 4 different options.

2. Next, let's use the given information to make some initial assumptions. For example, we know that the Dutch person is not the first person (since the plum eater is not to their left), so they must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

3. Let's solve the parity conditions first. Parity is an even or odd number of positions from the left. For example, if the Dutch is in position 2, then the fan rock (R) must be in an even position (4 or 2) because R is to the right of the Dutch (D).

4. Now, let's use the given conditions to eliminate impossible positions for each person. For example, if the Dutch is in position 2, and the fan rock is in position 4, then the person eating plum (P) cannot be in position 1 (since P is to the left of the Dutch and the fan rock).

5. Continue this process for all the conditions. Some positions will become impossible for certain people, and some people will have only one possible position left.

6. Once we've exhausted all the conditions, we'll be left with the final solution.

Here's the final solution table:

```
|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| iced-tea  | lemonade  | milk       |
| Food          | plum       | radish    | raspberry | zucchini   |
| Movie-Genre   | epic       | fantasy    | horror    | zombie     |
| Music-Genre   | country    | disco      | jazz      | rock       |
| Nationality   | australian | dutch      | german    | indonesian |
| Pet           | chinchilla | ferret    | hedgehog  | snake      |
| Transport     | airplane   | snowmobile | train     | van        |
```

This solution is based on the given conditions and assumptions. There might be multiple solutions possible due to the complexity of the puzzle and the assumptions made."
Lv11-7x4-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, let's use A for Beverage, B for Food, C for Hobby, D for Movie-Genre, E for Nationality, F for Pet, and G for Sport. Each variable will have 4 different values (since there are 4 people).

2. Let's also assign positions for each person from left to right (1, 2, 3, 4).

3. Now, let's use the given clues to eliminate possibilities. For example, from clue 1, we know that the person who cooks is either the one eating avocado or the Spanish is the one who cooks, or both. If the Spanish cooks, then the person eating avocado must be in a different position. Let's say the Spanish cooks and is in position 3, then the avocado eater must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

4. Continue this process for all the clues. Some clues will help eliminate possibilities for multiple variables at once, while others will only help with one.

5. Once you've used all the clues, you should be able to fill in the table for each variable in each position.

6. The final solution will be the table with the filled-in variables for each person and category.

Here's a simplified version of the table to help you get started:

|               |       1       |      2      |     3      |    4    |

| Food          | E            | F           | G          | H       |
| Hobby         | I            | J           | K          | L       |
| Movie-Genre   | M            | N           | O          | P       |

| Sport         | Y            | Z           | AA         | BB      |

Remember, the variables A, B, C, etc., represent the different options for each category, and the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 represent the positions of the people.

Good luck solving the puzzle! The final solution will be '#############' around the filled-in table."

|               |     1     |       2       |     3      |     4     |
| Beverage      | A (hot-chocolate) | B (juice) | C (lemonade) | D (water) |
| Food          | F (lemon) | E (cucumber) | G (watermelon) | H (pepper) |
| Hobby         | I (camping) | J (dancing) | K (hiking) | L (traveling) |
| Job           | M (manager) | N (german) | O (mechanic) | P (scientist) |
| Music-Genre   | Q (gospel) | R (reggae) | S (metal) | T (soul) |
| Nationality   | U (brazilian) | V (german) | W (italian) | X (russian) |
| Transport     | Y (bus) | Z (skateboard) | a (train) | b (tram) |

We can further deduce that Q is the journalist, T is not soul, and Z is the fan of R (reggae). However, we cannot determine the exact position of Q, T, and Z due to the ambiguity in clues 7, 17, and 25.

The final solution table with the additional information is:
