### Step 2: Apply the clues

- **Clue 9**: The Norwegian is on the far left. This places the Norwegian at position 1.
  
- **Clue 8**: The person drinking milk is in the middle. This places milk at position 3.

Now we have:

- **Clue 14**: The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. This means the person who likes blue must be at position 2.

Now we have:

| Position | Color   | Nationality | Cigar        | Beverage     | Pet      |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 1        |         | Norwegian   |              |              |          |

- **Clue 5**: The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. This means ivory cannot be in the last position (position 5), and green must be to the right of ivory. Therefore, the person who likes ivory must be at position 2 and the person who likes green must be at position 3.

Einstein_orig_green-1	green	6	"Let's carefully work through this puzzle step-by-step using the given clues.

### Step 1: Set up the grid

We have 5 positions, each corresponding to a person with different colors, nationalities, cigars, beverages, and pets. Let's set up the grid:

| Position | Color   | Nationality | Cigar        | Beverage     | Pet      |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 1        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 2        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 3        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 4        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 5        |         |             |              |              |          |

### Step 2: Apply the clues

#### **Clue 9:** The Norwegian is on the far left.
This means the Norwegian is at position 1.

| Position | Color   | Nationality | Cigar        | Beverage     | Pet      |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 1        |         | Norwegian   |              |              |          |
| 2        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 3        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 4        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 5        |         |             |              |              |          |

#### **Clue 8:** The person drinking milk is in the middle.
This means that position 3 drinks milk.

| Position | Color   | Nationality | Cigar        | Beverage     | Pet      |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 1        |         | Norwegian   |              |              |          |
| 2        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 3        |         |             |              | Milk         |          |
| 4        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 5        |         |             |              |              |          |

#### **Clue 14:** The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
This places the person who likes blue at position 2, because the Norwegian is at position 1.

| Position | Color   | Nationality | Cigar        | Beverage     | Pet      |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 1        |         | Norwegian   |              |              |          |
| 2        | Blue    |             |              |              |          |
| 3        |         |             |              | Milk         |          |
| 4        |         |             |              |              |          |
| 5        |         |             |              |              |          |

#### **Clue 5:** The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
This means ivory must be at position 2, and green must be at position 3. However, position 3 already has milk, so the person who likes green must be at position 4, and the person who likes ivory must be at position 2.

| Position | Color   | Nationality | Cigar        | Beverage     | Pet      |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 1        |         | Norwegian   |              |              |          |
| 2        | Ivory   |             |              |              |          |
| 3        |         |             |              | Milk         |          |
| 4        | Green   |             |              |              |          |
| 5        |         |             |              |              |          |

### Step 1: Set up the positions

We have 5 positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's assign information to each position step by step.

### Step 2: Apply Clues

- **Clue 9**: **The Norwegian is on the far left**. 
  - Therefore, the **Norwegian** must be in **Position 1**.
  
- **Clue 8**: **The person drinking milk is in the middle**.
  - So, **milk** must be in **Position 3**.

- **Clue 5**: **The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory**. 
  - Therefore, **Green** cannot be in **Position 1**, and **Ivory** cannot be in **Position 5**.

- **Clue 3**: **The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green**.
  - This means the person in **Position 3** drinks **milk**, and **Position 3** cannot be the person who likes green. So, **Position 4** or **Position 5** is where the coffee drinker (green lover) is.

- **Clue 12**: **The lucky-strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice**.
  - This tells us that the person who drinks **orange juice** must be smoking **Lucky-Strike**.

- **Clue 2**: **The Spanish is the owner of the dog**.
  - The **Spanish** person owns the **dog**.

- **Clue 6**: **The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails**.
  - The **Old-Gold** smoker owns **snails**.

  - The **Kools** smoker is next to the person who owns the **horse**.

- **Clue 13**: **The Japanese is the parliament-smoker**.
  - The **Japanese** person smokes **Parliament**.

- **Clue 14**: **The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue**.
  - The **Norwegian** must be next to the person who likes **blue**.

### Step 3: Fill out the positions

Let's try to fill in the table, keeping all clues in mind:

| Position | Nationality  | Color  | Beverage      | Cigar         | Pet        |
|----------|--------------|--------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | Yellow | Water         | Kools         | Horse      |
| 2        | Spanish      | Blue   | Orange-Juice  | Lucky-Strike  | Dog        |
| 3        | Ukrainian    | Ivory  | Milk          | Old-Gold      | Snails     |
| 4        | English      | Red    | Coffee        | Chesterfield  | Fox        |
| 5        | Japanese     | Green  | Tea           | Parliament    | Zebra      |

### Step 4: Find where the dog is

From the table, we see that the **Spanish** person owns the **dog**, and the **Spanish** is in **Position 2**.

### Answer: 
**dog:2**. The **dog** is in **Position 2**."	dog:4
Einstein_orig_fox-1	fox	9	"Let's break this puzzle down carefully, step by step, and fill out the grid.

### Step 1: Set up a grid

We have 5 positions to assign the details for each person. Let's use a table format, where each row corresponds to a different person and we have columns for nationality, color, beverage, cigar, and pet.

| Position | Nationality  | Color  | Beverage   | Cigar         | Pet    |
|----------|--------------|--------|------------|---------------|--------|
| 1        |              |        |            |               |        |
| 2        |              |        |            |               |        |
| 3        |              |        |            |               |        |
| 4        |              |        |            |               |        |
| 5        |              |        |            |               |        |

### Step 2: Apply the clues one by one

#### Clue 1: ""The English is the person who likes red.""
- The **English** person likes **red**.
- So, **English** = **red**.

#### Clue 2: ""The Spanish is the owner of the dog.""
- The **Spanish** person owns the **dog**.
- So, **Spanish** = **dog**.

#### Clue 3: ""The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green.""
- The person drinking **coffee** likes **green**.
- So, **coffee** = **green**.

#### Clue 4: ""The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea.""
- The **Ukrainian** drinks **tea**.
- So, **Ukrainian** = **tea**.

#### Clue 5: ""The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.""
- The person who likes **green** is to the right of the person who likes **ivory**.
- **Ivory** cannot be in position 5, and **green** must be in a position to the right of **ivory**.

#### Clue 6: ""The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.""
- The **old-gold** smoker owns **snails**.
- So, **old-gold** = **snails**.

#### Clue 7: ""The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow.""
- The **kools-smoker** likes **yellow**.
- So, **yellow** = **kools**.

#### Clue 8: ""The person drinking milk is in the middle.""
- The person drinking **milk** is in **Position 3**.
- So, **Position 3** = **milk**.

#### Clue 9: ""The Norwegian is on the far left.""
- The **Norwegian** is in **Position 1**.
- So, **Position 1** = **Norwegian**.

#### Clue 10: ""The chesterfield-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.""
- The **chesterfield-smoker** is adjacent to the **fox** owner.
- We will use this later.

#### Clue 11: ""The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.""
- The **kools-smoker** is adjacent to the **horse** owner.
- We will use this later.

#### Clue 12: ""The lucky-strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice.""
- The **lucky-strike-smoker** drinks **orange-juice**.
- So, **orange-juice** = **lucky-strike**.

#### Clue 13: ""The Japanese is the parliament-smoker.""

- So, **Japanese** = **parliament**.

#### Clue 14: ""The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.""
- The **Norwegian** is adjacent to the person who likes **blue**.
- So, **blue** must be in **Position 2** (because the Norwegian is in Position 1).

### Step 3: Fill in the grid

Using the clues we've gathered, let's fill in the grid.

- **Position 1** is the **Norwegian**. The **Norwegian** is next to **blue**, so **Position 2** must be the person who likes **blue**.
- **Position 3** drinks **milk**, so we can also fill in **Position 3** = **milk**.
- **Position 2** is the person who likes **blue**.
- **Position 3** drinks **milk**, so we know this person is not the **Spanish** (who owns the **dog**).
- **Position 1** is **Norwegian**, and **Position 5** must be **Spanish** (because the Spanish owns the **dog**).

| Position | Nationality  | Color  | Beverage     | Cigar         | Pet    |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | ?      | ?            | ?             | ?      |
| 2        | ?            | Blue   | ?            | ?             | ?      |
| 3        | ?            | ?      | Milk         | ?             | ?      |
| 4        | ?            | ?      | ?            | ?             | ?      |
| 5        | Spanish      | ?      | ?            | ?             | Dog    |

#### Use additional clues to complete the puzzle:

- **The person who likes green is to the right of ivory** (Clue 5). Ivory cannot be in Position 5, so **ivory** is likely in **Position 4**.
- The person who smokes **old-gold** owns **snails**. We place **old-gold** and **snails** in **Position 4**.
- **The kools-smoker** likes **yellow**. Place this in **Position 2** with **yellow**.
- **The person drinking coffee** is the person who likes **green** (Clue 3). This person must be in **Position 2**.
- The **lucky-strike-smoker** drinks **orange-juice**. This person must be in **Position 3**.

### Final Grid

| Position | Nationality  | Color  | Beverage     | Cigar         | Pet    |

### Step 2: Filling in nationalities

#### Clue 1: ""The English is the person who likes red.""
- Since the person in position 2 likes blue, the English person must be in position 3.

#### Clue 4: ""The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea.""

- The person who likes yellow must be in position 4.

#### Clue 3: ""The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green.""

#### Clue 6: ""The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.""
- The person who owns snails must be in position 3 and smoke Old Gold.

- **Cigars**: Old-Gold, Kools, Chesterfield, Lucky-Strike, Parliament
- **Beverages**: Coffee, Tea, Milk, Orange-juice, Water
- **Pets**: Dog, Fox, Zebra, Horse, Snails

### Step 2: Apply the clues

#### Clue 1: The **English** is the person who likes **red**.

- Therefore, the **English** is either in **Position 3** or **Position 4**.

#### Clue 2: The **Spanish** is the owner of the **dog**.
- The **Spanish** owns the **dog**, and since **Position 5** is for the **Spanish**, they must have the **dog** in **Position 5**.

#### Clue 3: The person drinking **coffee** is the person who likes **green**.
- The person who likes **green** drinks **coffee**.
- The **green** person must be to the right of the **ivory** person (Clue 5), so **green** cannot be in Position 1, and **ivory** cannot be in Position 5.
- **Position 5** already has **Spanish** and the **dog**, so the **green** person must be in **Position 4**, and they drink **coffee**.

#### Clue 4: The **Ukrainian** is the person drinking **tea**.
- The **Ukrainian** must be in **Position 2** and drink **tea**, as **Position 4** is already taken by the person drinking **coffee**.

#### Clue 5: The person who likes **green** is to the right of the person who likes **ivory**.
- Since **Position 4** is **green**, the person who likes **ivory** must be in **Position 3**.

#### Clue 6: The **old-gold-smoker** is the owner of the **snails**.
- The **Old-Gold** smoker owns the **snails**, and since **Position 3** is the **English** person, they must be the **Old-Gold** smoker, and their pet is **snails**.

#### Clue 7: The **kools-smoker** is the person who likes **yellow**.
- The **Kools** smoker must like **yellow**. The only remaining position where yellow can be is **Position 2**, so the **Kools** smoker is in **Position 2**.

#### Clue 8: The person drinking **milk** is in the middle.
- The person drinking **milk** must be in **Position 3**.

#### Clue 9: The **Norwegian** is on the far left.
- The **Norwegian** must be in **Position 1**.

#### Clue 10: The **Chesterfield-smoker** is on the left or right of the owner of the **fox**.
- This means that the **Chesterfield-smoker** is either in **Position 2** or **Position 4**. Since **Position 2** already has the **Kools** smoker, the **Chesterfield** smoker must be in **Position 4**, and their pet is the **fox**.

#### Clue 11: The **Kools-smoker** is to the left or right of the owner of the **horse**.
- The **Kools** smoker is in **Position 2**, so the **horse** must be in **Position 1**.

#### Clue 12: The **Lucky-Strike-smoker** is the person drinking **orange-juice**.
- The **Lucky-Strike** smoker is in **Position 5**, and they drink **orange-juice**.

#### Clue 13: The **Japanese** is the **Parliament-smoker**.
- The **Japanese** must be in **Position 3**, and they smoke **Parliament**.

#### Clue 14: The **Norwegian** is to the left or right of the person who likes **blue**.
- Since the **Norwegian** is in **Position 1**, the person who likes **blue** must be in **Position 2**.

### Step 3: Fill in the grid
Now we can fill in the grid based on all of the clues.

| Position | Nationality | Color   | Beverage      | Cigar         | Pet      |

- So, **Position Y** = **Spanish** and **dog**.

#### Clue 3: ""The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green.""

- So, **coffee** = **green**.

#### Clue 4: ""The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea.""
- The **Ukrainian** drinks **tea**.
- So, **Position Z** = **Ukrainian** and **tea**.

#### Clue 5: ""The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.""
- The person who likes **green** is to the right of the person who likes **ivory**.
- So, **ivory** cannot be in the last position, and **green** must be placed to the right of **ivory**.

- The **old-gold** smoker owns **snails**.
- So, **old-gold** = **snails**.

- We will use this later.

#### Clue 11: ""The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.""

- We will use this later.

#### Clue 12: ""The lucky-strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice.""

- So, **orange-juice** = **lucky-strike**.

#### Clue 13: ""The Japanese is the parliament-smoker.""

- So, **Japanese** = **parliament**.

#### Clue 14: ""The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.""

### Step 3: Fill in the grid based on the clues

Now, let’s fill in the grid using all the clues:

- **Position 1**: The **Norwegian** is on the far left (Clue 9), and the Norwegian is next to the person who likes **blue** (Clue 14). So, **Position 1** is **Norwegian** and **ivory**.
- **Position 2**: The person who likes **blue** must be in **Position 2** (Clue 14). The person who drinks **coffee** is the person who likes **green** (Clue 3), so the person in **Position 2** drinks **coffee** and likes **green**.
- **Position 3**: The person drinking **milk** is in the middle (Clue 8). This person is also not the **Norwegian** or the **Ukrainian**, so they must be the **English** who likes **red**.
- **Position 4**: This person smokes **old-gold** and owns the **snails** (Clue 6).
- **Position 5**: The **Spanish** person owns the **dog** (Clue 2), and this person must smoke **lucky-strike** and drink **orange-juice** (Clue 12).

### Step 2: Apply the clues

#### Clue 9: The Norwegian is on the far left.
This places the Norwegian in position 1.

| Position | Color   | Nationality | Cigar        | Beverage     | Pet      |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 1        |         | Norwegian   |              |              |          |

#### Clue 14: The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
Since the Norwegian is at position 1, the person who likes blue must be at position 2.

| Position | Color   | Nationality | Cigar        | Beverage     | Pet      |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 1        |         | Norwegian   |              |              |          |

#### Clue 5: The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
Thus, ivory must be at position 2, and green must be at position 3. However, position 3 already has milk, so green must go to position 4, and ivory goes to position 2.

|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------|

:4**"	red:3
Einstein_orig_green-3	green	3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step. We have 5 people, each with a set of attributes, and we are trying to figure out the position of **green**.

### Step-by-step breakdown:

#### 1. Assigning the 5 positions:
We know there are 5 people, so let's arrange them in positions 1 to 5.

#### 2. Using clues directly:
- **Clue 9:** ""The Norwegian is on the far left."" So, the Norwegian is in position 1.
  
- **Clue 8:** ""The person drinking milk is in the middle."" So, the person in position 3 drinks milk.
  
- **Clue 5:** ""The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory."" This means green cannot be in position 1, and ivory cannot be in position 5.
  
- **Clue 4:** ""The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea."" The Ukrainian must be in a position that matches their beverage, so we’ll place them later.

- **Clue 10:** ""The Chesterfield-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox."" This gives us some relative positioning for the Chesterfield smoker and the fox owner.

#### 3. Fill in based on nationality and beverage:
- **Clue 3:** ""The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green."" So, whoever likes green is also drinking coffee.
  
- **Clue 13:** ""The Japanese is the Parliament smoker."" So, the Japanese person smokes Parliament cigars.
  
- **Clue 7:** ""The Kools smoker is the person who likes yellow."" Therefore, the person who smokes Kools likes yellow.

#### 4. Finalizing details:
From all these clues, we can determine the exact placement of each individual. The process is lengthy, so let me walk you through the final answer step-by-step:

- **Position 1 (Norwegian)**: The Norwegian must be in the first position, drinks water (because milk is in the middle, and tea, coffee, orange juice, and milk are already assigned to others). The Norwegian likes blue (as per Clue 14), smokes Kools, and has a horse (Clue 11).

- **Position 2 (Ukrainian)**: The Ukrainian drinks tea, likes ivory, and has the fox (Clue 10). They smoke Chesterfield cigars.

- **Position 3 (Middle person)**: This person drinks milk and likes red. They smoke Old Gold and have snails (Clue 6). The English person is in this position.

- **Position 4 (Spanish)**: The Spanish person owns the dog (Clue 2), likes yellow, and smokes Lucky Strike (Clue 12).

- **Position 5 (Japanese)**: The Japanese person likes green, drinks coffee, smokes Parliament, and has a zebra (Clue 13).

| 5        |             |        |          |             |        |

### Step 2: Apply the clues one by one

#### Clue 1: ""The English is the person who likes red.""
- The **English** person likes **red**.
- So, **English** = **Red**.

#### Clue 2: ""The Spanish is the owner of the dog.""
- The **Spanish** person owns the **dog**.
- So, **Spanish** = **dog**.

### Step 3: Fill out the grid with known information

Now let's fill in the grid using the information we've gathered:

- **Position 1** is the **Norwegian**, so the Norwegian is either next to blue or green. Given Clue 14, **blue** must be in **Position 2** (because the Norwegian is adjacent to the person who likes blue).
- The person in **Position 2** must be the **blue** lover, so the **Norwegian** does not drink milk, and **milk** must be in **Position 3**.
- **Position 3** drinks **milk**, so we can also fill in that **milk** is the beverage for Position 3.

| Position | Nationality  | Color | Beverage | Cigar        | Pet    |
|----------|--------------|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
| 1        | Norwegian    | ?     | ?        | ?            | ?      |
